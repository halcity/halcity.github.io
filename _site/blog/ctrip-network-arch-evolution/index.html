  <h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>This article comes from my talk <strong><em>Ctrip Network Architecture Evolution in the
Cloud Computing Era</em></strong> at <a href="https://www.bagevent.com/event/GOPS2019-shenzhen">GOPS 2019
Shenzhen</a> (a tech conference
in Chinese). The content is gently re-structured to make it more
ease of reading as a post, and slightly updated to correct some inaccuracies.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>I’m currently a senior achitect at Ctrip cloud, and leading the network &amp;
storage development team. My main focus is on <strong>network virtualization</strong> and
<strong>distributed storage</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let’s start.</p>

<p>This post presents Ctrip’s network architecure evolution in the cloud
computing era. The content is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A brief introduction to Ctrip Cloud</li>
  <li>VLAN-based L2 Network</li>
  <li>SDN-based Large L2 Network</li>
  <li>K8S and Hybrid Network</li>
  <li>Cloud Native Solutions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-about-ctrip-cloud">0 About Ctrip Cloud</h2>

<p>Ctrip’s cloud computing team started at ~2013.</p>

<p>We started our business by providing compute resources to our internal customers
based on OpenStack. Since then, we have developed our own baremetal platform,
and further, deployed container platforms like Mesos and K8S.</p>

<p>In recent years, we have packed all our cloud services into a unified platform,
we named it CDOS - <strong><em>Ctrip Datacenter Operating System</em></strong>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/1.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 1. Ctrip Datacenter Operation System (CDOS)</p>

<p>CDOS manages all our compute, network and storage resources on both private and
public cloud (from vendors). In the private cloud, we provision VM, BM and container
instances. In the public cloud, we have integrated public cloud vendors like
AWS, Tecent cloud, UCloud, etc to provide VM and container instances to our internal
customers.</p>

<h3 id="network-evolution-timeline">Network Evolution Timeline</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/2.jpg" width="70%" height="70%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 2. Timeline of the Network Architecture Evolution</p>

<p>Fig 2 is a rough timeline of our network evolution.</p>

<p>At 2013, we started building our private cloud based on OpenStack, and we chose
a simple VLAN-based <strong>L2 network</strong> model. The underlying HW network topolopy was
traditional hierarchical network model (3-layer network model).</p>

<p>At 2016, we evolved to a SDN-based <strong>large L2 network</strong>, and the underlying HW
network evolved to Spine-Leaf model.</p>

<p>Starting from 2017, we began to deploy container platforms (mesos, k8s) on both
private and public cloud. In the private cloud, we extended our SDN
solution to integration container networks. On the public cloud, we also
designed our container network solution, and connected the public and private
cloud.</p>

<p>Now (2019), we are doing some investigations on <strong>cloud native solutions</strong> to
address the new challenges we are facing.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into those solutions in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="1-vlan-based-l2-network">1 VLAN-based L2 Network</h2>

<p>At 2013, we started building our private cloud based on OpenStack, provisioning
VM and BM instances to our internal customers.</p>

<h3 id="11-requirements">1.1 Requirements</h3>

<p>The requirements for network were as follows:</p>

<p>First, performance of the virtualized network should not be too bad compared
with baremetal networks, measuring with metrics such as instance-to-instance
latency, throughput, etc.</p>

<p>Secondly, it should have some L2 isolations to prevent common L2 problems e.g. flooding.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and this is really important - the <strong>instance IP should be routable</strong>.
That is to say, we could not utilize any tunnling techniques within the host.</p>

<p>At last, security concerns were less critical at that time. If sacrificing a
little security could give us a significant performance increase, that would be
acceptable. As in a private cloud environment, we have other means to ensure
security.</p>

<h3 id="12-solution-openstack-provider-network-model">1.2 Solution: OpenStack Provider Network Model</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/3.jpg" width="25%" height="25%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 3. OpenStack Provider Network Model</p>

<p>After some investigation, we chose the OpenStack <strong><em>provider network model</em></strong>
[1], as depicted in Fig 3.</p>

<p>The provider network model has following characteristics:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>L2 forwarding</strong> within host, <strong>L2 forwarding + L3 routing</strong> outside host</li>
  <li>Tenant gateways configured on HW devices. So this is a <strong>SW + HW solution</strong>,
rather than a pure SW solution</li>
  <li>Instance <strong>IP routable</strong></li>
  <li><strong>High performance</strong>. This comes mainly from two aspects:
    <ul>
      <li>No overlay encapsulation/decapsulation</li>
      <li>Gateways configured on HW device, which has far more better performance
compared with SW implemented virtual routers (L3 agent) in OpenStack</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Other aspects in our design:</p>

<ol>
  <li>L2 segmentation: VLAN</li>
  <li>ML2: OVS</li>
  <li>L2 Agent：Neutron OVS Agent</li>
  <li>L3 Agent: NO</li>
  <li>DHCP: NO</li>
  <li>Floating IP: NO</li>
  <li>Security Group：NO</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="13-hw-network-topology">1.3 HW Network Topology</h3>

<p>The HW network topology in our data center is Fig 4.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/4.png" width="60%" height="60%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 4. Physical Network Topology in the Datacenter</p>

<p>The bottom part are rack rows.  Each blade in the rack had two physical
NIC, connected to two adjacent ToR for physical HA.</p>

<p>The above part is a typical <strong><em>access - aggregate - core</em></strong> hierarchical network
model. Aggregate layer communicates with access layer via L2 forwarding, and
with core layer via L3 routing.</p>

<p>All OpenStack network gateways are configured on core routers. Besides, there
are HW firewalls connected to core routers to perform some security
enforcements.</p>

<h3 id="14-host-network-topology">1.4 Host Network Topology</h3>

<p>The virtual network topology within a compute node is shown in Fig 5.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/5.png" width="75%" height="75%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 5. Designed Virtual Network Topology within A Compute Node</p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two OVS bridges <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-int</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-bond</code>, connected directly</li>
  <li>Two physical NICs bonded into one virtual device, attached to <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-bond</code></li>
  <li>Host IP address also configured on <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-bond</code>, serving as management IP</li>
  <li>All instance devices (virtual NICs) attached to <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-int</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In the picture, <code class="highlighter-rouge">inst1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">inst2</code> are two instances from different networks.
The numbered devices started from <code class="highlighter-rouge">inst1</code> and ended at <code class="highlighter-rouge">inst2</code> is just the
packet traversing path between the two (cross network) instances. As can be
seen, there are 18 hops in total.</p>

<p>In contrast, Fig 6 shows the topology in legacy OpenStack provider network
model.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/6.png" width="75%" height="75%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 6. Virtual Network Topology within A Compute Node in Legacy OpenStack</p>

<p>The biggest difference here is: <strong>a Linux bridge sits between each instance
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-int</code></strong>. This is because OpenStack supports a feature called “security
group”, which uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> in the behind. Unfortunately, OVS ports do not
support <code class="highlighter-rouge">iptables</code> rules; but Linux bridge ports do support, so in OpenStack
a Linux bridge is inserted between each instance and <code class="highlighter-rouge">br-int</code>.</p>

<p>Except this, other parts are similar, so in this circumstance, the total hops is
24.</p>

<h3 id="15-summary">1.5 Summary</h3>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>First of all, we simplified OpenStack deployment architecture, removed some
components that we did not need, e.g. L3 agent, DHCP agent, Neutron metadata
agent, etc, and we no longer needed a standalone network node. For a team which
just started private cloud with not so much experience, the developing and
operating costs became relatively low.</p>

<p>Secondly, we simplified the host network topology by removing security groups.
The total hops between two instances from different networks was decreased from
24 to 18, thus has lower latency.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we had our gateways configured on HW devices, which had far more
better performance than OpenStack’s pure SW solutions.</p>

<p>And at last, the instance IP was routable, which benifited a lot to upper layer
systems such as tracking and monitoring systems.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantags">Disadvantags</h4>

<p>First, as has been said, we removed security groups. So the security is
sacrified at some extent. We compensated this partly by enforcing some security
rules on HW firewalls.</p>

<p>Secondly, the network provision process was less automatic. For example,
we had to configure the core routers whenever we add/delete networks to/from
OpenStack. Although these operations have a very low frequency, the impact of
core router misconfiguration is dramatic - it could affect the entire network.</p>

<h2 id="2-sdn-based-large-l2-network">2 SDN-based Large L2 Network</h2>

<h3 id="21-new-challenges">2.1 New Challenges</h3>

<p>Time arrived 2016, due to the scale expansion of our cluster and network, the
VLAN-based L2 network reached some limitations.</p>

<p>First of all, if you are familiar with data center networks you may know that
<strong>hierachical network model is hard to scale</strong>.</p>

<p>Secondly, all the OpenStack gateways were configured on the core
routers, which made them the potential bottleneck and <strong>single point of failure</strong>.
And more, core router failures will disrupt the entire network, so the <strong>failure
radius is very large</strong>.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that our blade was equipped with 2 x 1 Gbps NICs, which was
too old for modern data center and morden applications.</p>

<p>Besides, the VLAN has its own limitations: flooding in large VLAN segmentations
is still a problem, and number of avialble VLAN IDs is less than 4096.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we had also some new needs, as such:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our corp acquired some companies during the past years, and the networks of
those companies needed to connect/integrate to ours. At network
level, we’d like to treat those subsidiary companies as tenants, so we had
multitenancy and VPC needs.</li>
  <li>We’d like the network provision more automatic, with little human
intervention.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="22-solution-openstack--sdn">2.2 Solution: OpenStack + SDN</h3>

<p>Regarding to these requirements, we designed a <strong>HW+SW, OpenStack+SDN</strong> 
solution jointly with the <strong><em>data center network team</em></strong> in our corporation,
shifted the network <strong>from L2 to Large L2</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="hw-topology">HW Topology</h4>

<p>For the HW network topology, we evolved from the traditional 3-layer hierachical
model to <strong>Spine-Leaf model</strong>, which gets more and more popular in modern data
centers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/7.png" width="70%" height="70%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 7. Spine-Leaf Topology in the New Datacenter</p>

<p>Spine-Leaf model is full-mesh connected, which means every device in Spine
layer connects to every device in Leaf layer, and there is no connectitiy among
nodes in the same layer. This connectivity pattern brings many benifits:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Shorter traversing path and estimable latency</strong>: a server could reach any
other server in exactly 3 hops (server-to-server latency)</li>
  <li><strong>Ease of expansing</strong>: to increase the bandwidth, just add a node in one
layer and connect it to all other nodes in the other layer</li>
  <li><strong>More resilent to HW failures</strong>: all nodes are active, node failure radius
is far more smaller than in hierachical model</li>
</ol>

<p>For blades, we upgraded the NICs to 10 Gbps, and further to 25 Gbps.</p>

<h4 id="sdn-control-and-data-plane">SDN: Control and Data Plane</h4>

<p>We have separate control and data planes [2]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data plane: VxLAN</li>
  <li>Control plane: MP-BGP EVPN</li>
</ol>

<p>These are standard RFC protocols, refer to [2] for more protocol details and use
cases.</p>

<p>One additional benefit of this model is that it supports <strong>distributed
gateway</strong>, which means all leaf nodes are acted as (active) gateways, which
eliminates the performance bottleneck of traditional gateways on core routers.</p>

<p>This solution physically support multitenancy (via VRF).</p>

<h4 id="sdn-components-and-implementation">SDN: Components And Implementation</h4>

<p>We developed our own SDN controller <strong>Ctrip Network Controller</strong> (CNC).</p>

<p>CNC is a central SDN controller, and manges all Spine and Leaf nodes. It
integrates with Neutron server via Neutron plugins, and is able to dynamically
add configurations to Spine/Leaf nodes.</p>

<p>Neutron changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add CNC ML2 &amp; L3 plugins</li>
  <li>New finite state machine (FSM) for port status</li>
  <li>New APIs interact with CNC</li>
  <li>DB schema changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is the monitoring panel for the neutron port states in a real data center.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/8.png" width="40%" height="40%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 8. Monitoring Panel for Neutron Port States</p>

<h3 id="23-hw--sw-topology">2.3 HW + SW Topology</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/9.png" width="90%" height="90%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 9. HW + SW Topology of the Designed SDN Solution</p>

<p>Fig 9 is the overall HW + SW topology.</p>

<p>VxLAN encap/decap is done on the leaf
nodes. If we draw a horizeontal line to cross all Leaf nodes, this line splits
the entire network into underlay and overlay. The bottom part (below leaf)
belongs to underlay and is isolated by VLAN; The above part (above leaf) is
overlay and isolated by VxLAN.</p>

<p>Underlay is controlled by Neutron server, OVS and neutron-ovs-agent, overlay is
controlled by CNC. CNC integrates with Neutron via Neutron plugins.</p>

<p>As has been said, this is a joint work by cloud network team &amp; data center
network team. We cloud network team focuses mainly on the underlay part.</p>

<h3 id="24-spawn-an-instance">2.4 Spawn An Instance</h3>

<p>In this solution, when spawning an instance, how the instance’s network gets reachable?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/10.png" width="90%" height="90%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 10. Flow of Spawn An Instance</p>

<p>Major steps depicted in Fig 10:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nova API (controller node): Create instance -&gt; schedule to one compute node</li>
  <li>Nova compute: spawn instance on this node</li>
  <li>Nova compute -&gt; Neutron server: create neutron port</li>
  <li>Neutron server: create port (IP, MAC, GW, etc)</li>
  <li>Neutron server -&gt; CNC plugin -&gt; CNC: send port info</li>
  <li>CNC: save port info to its own DB</li>
  <li>Neutron server -&gt; Nova compute: return the created port’s info</li>
  <li>Nova compute: create network device (virtual NIC) for instance, configure device (IP, MAC, GW, etc), then attach it to OVS</li>
  <li>OVS agent: detect new device attached -&gt; configure OVS (add flow) -&gt; <strong>Underlay network OK</strong></li>
  <li>Nova compute -&gt; Neutron server: update port <code class="highlighter-rouge">host_id</code>. The message is something like this: port <code class="highlighter-rouge">1234</code> is on host <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-1</code></li>
  <li>Neutron server -&gt; CNC: update port <code class="highlighter-rouge">host_id</code>, something like this: port <code class="highlighter-rouge">1234</code> is on host <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-1</code></li>
  <li>CNC: retrieve database, get the leaf interfaces that <code class="highlighter-rouge">node-1</code> connected to, dynamically add configurations to these interfaces -&gt; <strong>Overlay network OK</strong></li>
  <li>Both underlay and overlay networks OK -&gt; instance reachable</li>
</ol>

<p>In Fig 10, black lines are legacy OpenStack flows, and blue lines are newly
added by us.</p>

<h3 id="25-summary">2.5 Summary</h3>

<p>A summary of the SDN-based large L2 network solution.</p>

<h4 id="hw">HW</h4>

<p>First, HW network model evolved from hierarchical (3-layer) network to
Spine-Leaf (2-tier). With the Spine-Leaf full-mesh connectivity,
server-to-server latency gets more lower.  Spine-Leaf also supports distributed
gateway, which means all leaf nodes act as gateway for the same network, not
only decreased the traversing path, but also alleviated the bottleneck of
central gateways.</p>

<p>Another benefit of full-mesh connectivity is that the HW network are now more
resilient to failures. All devices are active rather than active-backup
(traditional 3-layer model), thus when one device fails, it has far more
smaller failure radius.</p>

<h4 id="sw">SW</h4>

<p>For the SW part, we developed our own SDN controller, and integrated it with
OpenStack neutron via plugins.  The SDN controller cloud dynamically send
configurations to HW devices.</p>

<p>Although we have only mentioned VM here, this solution actually
supports both VM and BM provision.</p>

<h4 id="multi-tenancy--vpc-support">Multi-tenancy &amp; VPC support</h4>

<p>At last, this solution supports multi-tenancy and VPC.</p>

<h2 id="3-k8s--hybrid-cloud-network">3 K8S &amp; Hybrid Cloud Network</h2>

<p>At 2017, we started to deploy container platforms, migrating some
applications from VM/BM to containers.</p>

<p>Container orchestrators (e.g. Mesos, K8S) has different characteristics compared
with VM orchestrator (e.g OpenStack), such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large scale instances, 10K ~ 100K containers per cluster is commonly seen</li>
  <li>Higher deploy/destroy frequencies</li>
  <li>Shorter spawn/destroy time: ~10s (VM: ~100s)</li>
  <li>Container failure/drifting is the norm rather than exception</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="31-k8s-network-in-private-cloud">3.1 K8S Network In Private Cloud</h3>

<p>Characteristics of container platform raised new requirements to the network.</p>

<h4 id="311-network-requirements">3.1.1 Network Requirements</h4>

<p>First, The network API must be high performance, and supporting concurrency.</p>

<p>Secondly, whether using an agent or a binary to configure network (create vNICs
and configure them), it should be fast enough.</p>

<p>To sucessfully sell container platforms to our customers, we must keep
a considerable amount of compatibility with existing systems.</p>

<p>One of these is: we must <strong>keep the IP address unchanged when container drifts
from one node to another</strong>. This is an anti-pattern to container platform’s
philosophy, as those orchestrators are desgined to weaken the IP address: users
should only see the service that a container exposed, but not the IP address of
a single container.  The reason why we have to comprimise here is that in
OpenStack age, VM migration keeps the IP unchanged. So lots of outer systems
assumed that IP address is an immutable attribute of an instance during its
lifecycle, and they designed their systems based on this assumption. If we
suddenly break this assumption, lots of systems (SOA, SLB, etc) need to be
refactored, and this is out of our control.</p>

<h4 id="312-solution-extend-sdn-to-support-mesosk8s">3.1.2 Solution: Extend SDN to Support Mesos/K8S</h4>

<p>In private cloud, we decided to extend our SDN solution to integrate container
networks. We reused existing infrastructures, including Neutron, CNC, OVS,
Neutron-OVS-Agent. And then developed a CNI plugin for neutron.</p>

<p>Some changes or newly added components listed below.</p>

<h5 id="neutron-changes">Neutron Changes</h5>

<p>First, we added some new APIs, e.g. legacy Neutron supports only allocating port
by network ID, we added label attributes to Neutron <code class="highlighter-rouge">networks</code> model, supporting
allocating port by network labels. For example, CNI plugin will say, <strong><em>“I want
a port allocated from any network with ‘prod-env’ label”</em></strong>. This decouples K8S
from OpenStack details and is more scalable, because a label could mapping to
any number of networks.</p>

<p>Next, we did some performance optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add Bulk port API</li>
  <li>Database access optimizations</li>
  <li>Async API for high concurrency</li>
  <li>Critical path refactor</li>
</ul>

<p>We also backported some new features from upstream, e.g. graceful OVS agent
restart, a big benefit for network operators.</p>

<h5 id="new-k8s-cni-plugin-for-neutron">New K8S CNI plugin for neutron</h5>

<p>K8S CNI plugin creates and deletes networks for each Pod. The jobs it does are
much the same with other CNI plugins (e.g Calico, Flannel): creates veth pair,
attaches to OVS and container netns, configures MAC, IP, GW, etc.</p>

<p>Two big differences seperating it from other plugins:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Communicate with Neutron (central IPAM) to allocate/free port (IP address)</li>
  <li>Update port information to neutron server after finishing</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="existing-network-servicescomponents-upgrade">Existing network services/components upgrade</h5>

<p>We also upgraded some network infra. E.g. we’ve hit some OVS bugs
during past few years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ovs-vswitchd 100% CPU bug [3]</li>
  <li>OVS port mirror bug [4]</li>
</ul>

<p>So we upgraded OVS to the latest LTS <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.5.6</code>, which has solved those bugs.</p>

<h4 id="313-pod-drifting">3.1.3 Pod Drifting</h4>

<p>Network steps in starting a container are much the same as in
spawning a VM in Fig. 10, so we do not detail it here.</p>

<p>Fig 11 shows how the IP address stayed unchanged during container drifting. The
key point is: CNI plugin knows how to join some Pod labels into a port <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code>.
This <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> is unique index, so the second node (node B) could get the IP
address information from neutron with this name.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/11.png" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 11. Pod drifting with the same IP within a K8S cluster </p>

<h4 id="314-summary">3.1.4 Summary</h4>

<p>A quick summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We integrated container platform into existing infra in a short time</li>
  <li>Single global IPAM manages all VM/BM/container networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Sum up, <strong>this is the latest network solution int private cloud</strong>.</p>

<p>Current deployment scale of this new solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 availability zones (AZ)</li>
  <li>Up to 500+ physical nodes (VM/BM/Container hosts) per AZ</li>
  <li>Up to 500+ instances per host</li>
  <li>Up to 20K+ instances per AZ</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="315-future-architecture">3.1.5 Future Architecture</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/12.png" width="85%" height="85%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 12. Layered view of the future network architecture</p>

<p>Fig 12 is an architucture we’d like to achieve in the future.</p>

<p>First, the network will be split into underlay and overlay planes. IaaS and other
Infra services deploy in underlay network, e.g OpenStack, CNC. Then creating VPC
in overlay networks, and deploying VM and BM instances in VPCs. These have been
achieved.</p>

<p>One K8S cluster will be kept within one VPC, and each cluster manages its own
networks. All access via IP address should be kept within that cluster, and all
access from outside of the cluster should go through Ingress - the K8S native
way. We haven’t achieved this, because it needs lots of SW and HW system
refactors.</p>

<h3 id="32-k8s-on-public-cloud">3.2 K8S on Public Cloud</h3>

<h4 id="321-requirements">3.2.1 Requirements</h4>

<p>Ctrip started its internationalization in recent years, in the techical layer,
we should be able to support global deployment, which means provisioning
resources outside mainland China.</p>

<p>Building overseas private cloud is not practical, as the designing and building
process will take too much time. So we chose to purchase public cloud
resources, and integrate them to our private cloud infra, turning CDOS into
a hybrid cloud platform. CDOS API will abstract out all vendor-specific details,
and provide a unified API to our internal customers/systems.</p>

<p>This work involves networking solutions on public cloud platforms.</p>

<h4 id="322-k8s-network-solution-on-aws">3.2.2 K8S Network Solution on AWS</h4>

<p>Taking AWS as example, let’s see our K8S network solution.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/13.png" width="70%" height="70%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 13. K8S network solution on public cloud vendor (AWS)</p>

<p>First, spawning EC2 instances as K8S nodes on AWS. Then we developed a CNI
plugin to dynamically plug/unplug ENI to EC2 [5, 6].  The ENIs were given to
Pods as its vNIC.</p>

<p>We developed a global IPAM service (just like Neutron in OpenStack) and deployed
in VPC, it manages all network resources, and calls AWS APIs for real
allocation/deallocation.</p>

<p>The CNI plugin also supports attach/detach floating IP to Pods.  And again, the
IP address stays the same when Pod drifts from one node to another.  This is
achieved by ENI drifting.</p>

<h4 id="323-vpcs-over-the-globe">3.2.3 VPCs over the globe</h4>

<p>Fig 14 is the global picture of our VPCs in both private and public cloud.</p>

<p>We have some VPCs in our private cloud distributed in Shanghai and Nantong.
Outside mainland China, we have VPCs on public cloud regions, including
Seoul, Moscow, Frankfurt, California, Hong Kong, Melborne, and many more.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/14.png" width="70%" height="70%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 14. VPCs distributed over the globe </p>

<p>Network segments of VPCs on both prviate and public cloud are arranged to be
non-overlapped, so we connect them with direct connect techniques, and the IP
is routable (if needed).</p>

<p>OK, right here, I have introduced all of the major aspects of our network
evolution. In the next, let’s see some new challenges in the cloud native age.</p>

<h2 id="4-cloud-native-solutions">4 Cloud Native Solutions</h2>

<p>The current network solution faced some new challenges in cloud native era:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Central IPAM may be the new bottleneck, and Neutron is not designed for performance</li>
  <li>Cloud native prefers local IPAM (IPAM per host)</li>
  <li>Large failure radius: IP drifting among entire AZ</li>
  <li>Dense deployment of containers will hit HW limit of leaf nodes</li>
  <li>Increasingly strong host firewall (L4-L7) needs</li>
</ul>

<p>So we are doing some investigations on new solutions, e.g. Calico, Cilium.
Calico has been widely used nowadays, so I’ll skip it and give some
introduction to a relatively less well-known solution: Cilium.</p>

<h3 id="41-cilium-overview">4.1 Cilium Overview</h3>

<p>Cilium is a brand-new solution [7], and it needs Kernel 4.8+.</p>

<p>Cilium’s core relies on eBPF/BPF, which is a bytecode sandbox in Linux kernel.
If you never heard of this, think BPF as iptables, it could hook and
modify packets in the kernel stack, we will tell the difference later.</p>

<p>Cilium relies on BPF to achieve connectivity &amp; security.
It has following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CLI</li>
  <li>Plugin for orchestrator (Mesos, K8S, etc) integration</li>
  <li>Policy repository (etcd or consul)</li>
  <li>Host agent (also acts as local IPAM)</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/15.png" width="60%" height="60%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 15. Cilium</p>

<h3 id="42-host-networking">4.2 Host Networking</h3>

<p>Any networking solution could be split into two major parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Host-networking: instance-to-instance communication, and instance-to-host communication</li>
  <li>Multi-host-networking: cross-host and/or cross-subnet instance-to-instance communication</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s see the host-networking of Cilium.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ctrip-net-evolution/16.png" width="45%" height="45%" /></p>
<p align="center">Fig 16. Cilium host-networking</p>

<p>First, each host runs a Cilium agent, the agent acts as local IPAM, and manages its CIDR.
Upon starting, it creates a veth pair named <code class="highlighter-rouge">cilium_host &lt;--&gt; cilium_net</code>, and
sets the first IP address of the CIDR to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cilium_host</code>, which then acts as the
gateway of the CIDR.</p>

<p>When starting a Pod in this host, the CNI plugin will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allocate an IP address from this CIDR</li>
  <li>create a veth pair for the Pod</li>
  <li>configure the IP, gateway info to Pod</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the topology will look like Fig 16. Note that there is no OVS or
Linux bridges among the Pods’ veth pairs and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cilium_host &lt;--&gt; cilium_net</code>.
Actually there are also no special ARP entries or route entries to connect the
veth pairs. Then how does the packet been forwarded when it reaches the veth
pair end? The answer is <strong>BPF code</strong>. CNI plugin will <strong>generate BPF rules,
compile them and inject them into kernel</strong> to bridge the gaps between veth pairs.</p>

<p>Summary of cilium host networking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inst-to-inst: BPF + Kernel Stack L2 forward</li>
  <li>Inst-to-host: BPF + L3 Routing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="43-multi-host-networking">4.3 Multi-host networking</h3>

<p>For multi-host networking, Cilium provides two commonly used ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VxLAN overlay</li>
  <li>BGP direct routing</li>
</ul>

<p>If using VxLAN, Cilium will create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cilium_vxlan</code> device in each host, and do
VxLAN encap/decap by software. The performance will be a big concern, although
VxLAN HW offload will partly alleviate the burden.</p>

<p>BGP is another choice. In this case, you need to run a BGP agent in each host,
the BGP agent will do peering with outside network. This needs data center
network support. On public cloud, you could also try the BGP API.
BGP solution has better performance compared with VxLAN overlay, and more
importantly, it makes the container IP routable.</p>

<h3 id="44-pros--cons">4.4 Pros &amp; Cons</h3>

<p>Here is a brief comparison according to my understanding and experiment.</p>

<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>

<ul>
  <li>K8S-native L4-L7 security policy support</li>
  <li>High performance network policy enforcement</li>
  <li>Theoretical complexity: BPF O(1) vs iptables O(n)</li>
  <li>High performance forwarding plane (veth pair, IPVLAN)</li>
  <li>Dual stack support (IPv4/IPv6)</li>
  <li>Support run over flannel (Cilium only handles network policy)</li>
  <li>Active community
    <ul>
      <li>Development driven by a company</li>
      <li>Core developers from kernel community</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>

<p><strong>Latest kernel (4.8+ at least, 4.14+ better) needed</strong>. lots of companies’
PROD environments run kernels older than this.</p>

<p><strong>Not enough user stories &amp; best practices yet</strong>. Everyone say Cilium is
brilliant, but no one claim they have been widely used in their large scale
PROD environments.</p>

<p><strong>High dev &amp; ops costs</strong>. Compared with iptables-based solutions, e.g. Calico.
Big companies usually have customization needs because all of reasons, e.g.
compatibility with old systems to not break the business. The development
would need a gentle understanding with kernel stack: you should be familir
with kernel data structures, know the packet traversing path, have a
considerable experience with C programming - as BPF code is written in C.</p>

<p>Trouble shooting and debugging. You should equipped yourself with Cilium trouble
shooting skills, which are different from iptables-based solutions. While in
many cases, their maybe a shortage of proper trouble shooting tools.</p>

<p>But at last, <strong>Cilium/eBPF is still one of the most exciting techs rised in
recent years</strong>, and it’s still under fast developing. So, have a try and find
the fun!</p>
